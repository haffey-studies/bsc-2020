Thank you for participating in the study. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between social communication, mood, worry, resilience during lockdown and pleasant image preferences. Further, we were interested in investigating differences in way people view different concepts, including environmentally friendly beliefs and whether they predicted environmentally friendly behaviour.<br>
<br>
