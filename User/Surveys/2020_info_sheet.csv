You are being invited to take part in some research. Before you decide whether or not to participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please read the following information carefully.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the purpose of the research? <br></b>
We are conducting research exploring a variety of behaviour and personality traits. We want to understand social behaviour, some of which is in relation to how you felt during the first month of lockdown in response to the pandemic. To understand your responses to some pleasant and neutral images we will also ask you to rate the images and look at them. We’ll also ask you to rate how comfortable you feel in a series of interactions. Your participation in this study will require four sessions which should take about 2 hours.<br>
<br>
<b>Who is carrying out the research? <br></b>
The data are being collected by under the supervision of Dr Anthony Haffey, Keren MacLennan, Dr Nick Thompson and Tim Rossow, in the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at University of Reading. The research has been approved by the School and University ethics committees. <br>
<br>
<b>What happens if I agree to take part? <br></b>
If you agree to take part in this research, you will be asked to take part in a task where you will view matched pairs of images, whilst your eye movements are recorded. This will require us to use your webcam to capture where you are looking on the screen. We will only store the positions you are looking at, not the video footage used to calculate these. <br>
<br>
You will also be asked to complete a series of questionnaires that capture personality traits, your demographics and how you felt during the first month of lockdown. Finally, there’s a task where you’ll rate how you feel in a variety of social situations that are either in person or done via video communication.<br>
<br>
<b>Are there any risks associated with taking part? <br></b>
One possible risk in this study is that some of the questionnaires relate to mental health conditions, and we’re concerned that completing these questions might make you worry about whether your responses indicate that you have a mental health condition. Whilst responses to these questionnaires don’t strongly indicate whether someone needs treatment for their mental health, we will be providing links for further support if you think that they might be relevant to you after completing the study.<br>
<br>
<b>What will happen to the information I provide? <br></b>
Your data will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only an anonymous number identifying it. All identifiable information collected for the project such as the consent form (or your student number if you use this to identify yourself), will be destroyed after a period of 60 months from the when the completion of the project has elapsed. <br>
An analysis of the information will form part of our report at the end of the study and may be presented to interested parties and published in scientific journals and related media.  Note that all information presented in any reports or publications will be anonymous and unidentifiable.<br>
<br>
<b>Is participation voluntary and what if I wish to later withdraw? <br></b>
Taking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason. Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have about this study at any point by e-mailing a.haffey@reading.ac.uk .<br>
<br>
<b>What if I have other questions? <br></b>
If you have further questions about this study, please do not hesitate to contact the student experimenter or supervisors listed above. <br>
